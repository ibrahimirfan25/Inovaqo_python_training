# Python Basics Practice – Day 1

This repository contains what i did, Python practice from my internship at Inovaqo.  
Today I focused on understanding the core fundamentals of Python.

## Topics I Practiced
- Basic Python syntax and printing
- Variables and how they work
- Different Python data types (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dicts, etc.)
- Type casting (converting values between different types)
- Python literals
- Basic operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, identity, membership)
